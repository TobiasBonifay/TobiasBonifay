# Hi, I'm Tobias Bonifay
_Student in 5th year of engineering school at [Polytech Nice](https://polytech.univ-cotedazur.fr)_<br>
_Specialized in Software Architecture_

## Who am I? 

An engineering student hailing from Nice, France. Currently, I am 22 years old and thriving to grasp every opportunity that can enhance my skills in Java.

I'm enthusiastic about any potential opportunities or projects that involve Java development.

### What I'm focusing on 

My insatiable curiosity drives me to constantly expand my knowledge base. I am particularly keen to refine my skills in software development tools such as Git, algorithms, and object-oriented programming.

```java
public class Tobias {
  String[] pronouns = {"he", "him"};
  String[] languages = {"Java", "Python", "C", "HTML", "CSS", "JS"};
  String brainStatus = "Always ready to learn and adapt";

  public void eat() {
    System.out.println("Eating healthy to stay productive!");
  }

  public void sleep() {
    System.out.println("Getting enough sleep to stay refreshed!");
  }

  public void code() {
    System.out.println("Coding with passion and efficiency!");
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Tobias tobias = new Tobias();
    tobias.eat();
    tobias.sleep();
    tobias.code();
  }
}
```
