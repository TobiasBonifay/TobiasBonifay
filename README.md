# Hi, I'm Tobias Bonifay
_Student in 5th year of engineering school at [Polytech Nice](https://polytech.univ-cotedazur.fr)_<br>
_Specialized in Software Architecture_

## Who am I? 

An engineering student hailing from Nice, France. Currently, I am 22 years old and thriving to grasp every opportunity that can enhance my skills in Java.

I'm enthusiastic about any potential opportunities or projects that involve Java development.

### What I'm focusing on 

My insatiable curiosity drives me to constantly expand my knowledge base. I am particularly keen to refine my skills in software development tools such as Git, algorithms, and object-oriented programming.

```java
package world;

class Tobias implements Human, CodingAbility {

  private final String[] pronouns = {"he", "him"};
  private final String[] languages = {"Java", "Kotlin", "Python"};
  private final String brainStatus = "Always ready to learn and adapt";

  @Override
  public void eat() {
    System.out.println("Eating healthy to stay productive!");
  }

  /**
   * Sometimes it is necessary...
   */
  @Override
  public void sleep() {
    System.out.println("Getting enough sleep to stay refreshed!");
  }

  /**
   * Codes like a caffeinated keyboard warrior!
   * This method encapsulates the coding action which involves vigorous typing, a lot of coffee, and the occasional dance of victory on successful debugging.
   */
  @Override
  public void code() {
    System.out.println("Coding with passion and efficiency!");
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    final Tobias tobias = new Tobias();
    tobias.eat();
    tobias.sleep();
    tobias.code();
  }

}
```
